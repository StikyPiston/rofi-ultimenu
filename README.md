# rofi-ultimenu
A Rofi configuration, combining useful modi into a single view

## Setup
To set up the **Ultimenu**, first clone the git repo:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StikyPiston/rofi-ultimenu
```

Then, copy the `config.rasi` file into your `~/.config/rofi/` folder.

Change up the rest of the config, especially the colorscheme becuase I rushed it :P
